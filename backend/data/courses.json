Through  this \ncourse, students are expected to acquire familiarity with several \nof  the following:  Proposals, feasibility  reports, formal  project  re-\nports,  short  reports,  memos,  negotiations,  contracts,  etc.  In  the \nprocess principles of project formulation and evaluation, such as \ntechnical considerations; performance specifications; preliminary \nblock diagrams, types and analysis of contracts; cost estimation \nconcepts,  work  breakdown  structure;  project  data  preparation, \nscheduling facilities etc., would be introduced. The course would \ninvariably include the preparation of a detailed report embodying \nas many of the above concepts as appropriate."
